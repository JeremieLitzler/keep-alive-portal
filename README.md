# An Simple Portal To Keep Supbase Nano Project Alive

- Define your Supabase projects in a `.env`. See `.env.prod` for details.
- Deploy to Netlify
- Run a daily [Deadlinkchecker](https://www.deadlinkchecker.com/automatic-broken-link-check.asp) schedule for $9.95 / month. PS: I use Deadlinkchecker for my blogs to keep them HTTP-404 free and I have a "slot" available.
